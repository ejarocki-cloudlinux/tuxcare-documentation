# Endless Lifecycle Support for Language Ecosystems

<ELSTechnology />

## Installation for Language Ecosystems

:::tip
Have a subscription for an individual library or framework? Use the installation instructions on your library's page in the sections below.
:::

An ELS for Language Ecosystems subscription covers an entire language ecosystem rather than an individual library: TuxCare-patched versions of all supported packages for that language are delivered through the TuxCare-managed registry.

* **JavaScript** — covers TuxCare-patched versions of supported npm packages, delivered through the TuxCare npm registry as drop-in replacements for their end-of-life upstream releases. Follow the canonical installation instructions on the [SecureChain + ELS JavaScript page](/securechain/javascript/#ELS).

* **Java** — covers TuxCare-patched versions of supported Java libraries, delivered through a TuxCare-managed Maven repository as drop-in replacements for their end-of-life upstream releases. Installation instructions are provided during onboarding; if you need them again, contact the team through the [TuxCare Support Portal](https://tuxcare.com/support-portal/).

* **Python** — covers TuxCare-patched versions of supported Python packages, delivered through a TuxCare-managed PyPI-compatible index as drop-in replacements for their end-of-life upstream releases. Installation instructions are provided during onboarding; if you need them again, contact the team through the [TuxCare Support Portal](https://tuxcare.com/support-portal/).

* **PHP** — covers TuxCare-patched versions of supported PHP packages, delivered through a TuxCare-managed Composer repository as drop-in replacements for their end-of-life upstream releases. Installation instructions are provided during onboarding; if you need them again, contact the team through the [TuxCare Support Portal](https://tuxcare.com/support-portal/).

* **.NET** — covers TuxCare-patched versions of supported NuGet packages, delivered through a TuxCare-managed NuGet feed as drop-in replacements for their end-of-life upstream releases. Installation instructions are provided during onboarding; if you need them again, contact the team through the [TuxCare Support Portal](https://tuxcare.com/support-portal/).

## Vulnerability Coverage and Target Response Times

TuxCare employs the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) to assess the severity of security vulnerabilities. Our severity rating system integrates both NVD scoring and vendor scoring (when available); when the vendor's score is lower than the NVD score, we prioritize the NVD score.

Aligning with many industry standards and regulatory requirements, TuxCare is committed to delivering timely security updates. For instance, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) mandates that all 'High' vulnerabilities (CVSS score of 7.0+) must be addressed within 30 days. Other regulations and standards, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for healthcare or the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) for government agencies, uphold similar requirements.

* **Vulnerability coverage.** TuxCare shall provide security patches for critical- and high-risk (CVSS 7.0 and above), medium-risk (CVSS 4.0 to 6.9), and low-risk (CVSS 0.1 to 3.9) vulnerabilities. TuxCare reserves the right to offer a mitigation strategy as an alternative to a direct code fix.

* **Response time.** TuxCare will make commercially reasonable efforts to adhere to the following guidelines when addressing vulnerabilities:
    * **High- and critical-risk vulnerabilities (CVSS 7.0 and above):** Patches are provided within 14 days from the date the vulnerabilities are publicly disclosed.
    * **Medium-risk vulnerabilities (CVSS 4.0 to 6.9):** Patches are provided within 60 days from the date the vulnerabilities are publicly disclosed.
    * **Low-risk vulnerabilities (CVSS 0.1 to 3.9):** Patches are provided within 90 days from the date the vulnerabilities are publicly disclosed.

## Incident Reporting and Response Timeframe

Customers can report vulnerabilities by submitting a ticket through the [TuxCare Support Portal](https://tuxcare.com/support-portal/). TuxCare commits to providing an initial response to any reported issue within 3 days.

Requests for customer-directed security patches for CVEs that are outside of the ELS for Language Ecosystems scope will be reviewed within 3 working days. If the request is accepted, we will provide the patch within the next 60 days.

Handling Multiple Vulnerabilities: In cases where several CVEs are reported simultaneously for fixing, TuxCare will discuss and agree upon resolution timelines separately with the customer.

## Enhanced Transparency & Visibility

TuxCare's commitment to transparency and visibility is foundational to our ELS for Language Ecosystems offering. We aim to provide comprehensive details about how each package is built, verified, and distributed, ensuring complete trust in the software supply chain.

<!-- * **SLSA Compliance**: All packages are built and signed to ensure verifiable Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) compliance. They are securely constructed from vetted sources, include attestations for all dependencies, and undergo continuous testing to maintain integrity and security.
-->
* **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)**: Machine-readable SBOMs provide visibility into package composition and dependencies, supporting software supply chain transparency and accountability. Depending on the package, SBOMs are provided in industry-standard formats — SPDX and CycloneDX. See [Machine-Readable Security Data](./machine-readable-security-data/) for per-ecosystem links.

:::warning
Note: SBOM availability for certain components is still expanding and may vary by package. Contact [sales@tuxcare.com](mailto:sales@tuxcare.com) for current availability details.
:::

* **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX)**: Machine-readable VEX documents provide contextual vulnerability information, helping teams understand which known CVEs affect specific package versions and reduce remediation noise. VEX is published in standard formats, including CycloneDX VEX. See [Machine-Readable Security Data](./machine-readable-security-data/) for per-ecosystem feeds and details.
* **Verifiable Integrity and Provenance**: Our packages and metadata provide comprehensive end-to-end provenance, detailing how each package was constructed and tested, ensuring that all components in your software stack are trustworthy.

:::warning
Note: This feature is under consideration for future development and may be available at a later date. If you are interested, please contact [sales@tuxcare.com](mailto:sales@tuxcare.com).
:::

* **Secure Distribution**: Signed versions of the packages and their metadata are distributed from a registry managed, secured, and protected by TuxCare, guaranteeing that your software updates are authentic and untampered.
