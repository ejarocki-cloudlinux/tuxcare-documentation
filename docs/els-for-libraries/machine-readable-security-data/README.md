# Machine-Readable Security Data (SBOM, VEX, GPG)

TuxCare provides machine-readable security data and verification tooling for Endless Lifecycle Support (ELS) for Libraries:

* **SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)** — package composition and dependency inventory in SPDX and CycloneDX formats
* **VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange)** — exploitability status for known CVEs in CycloneDX VEX format
* **Package signatures (GPG)** — detached OpenPGP signatures to verify each artifact's authenticity and integrity
* **Integrity violation logging** — detecting and retaining integrity-check failures for administrator review

Released fixes are available via [tuxcare.com/cve-tracker](https://tuxcare.com/cve-tracker/) and [security.tuxcare.com](https://security.tuxcare.com/).

## Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

Each package built by TuxCare ships with an SBOM that lists its components, versions, and dependency relationships. SBOMs are provided in industry-standard formats — SPDX and CycloneDX — so they can be consumed by any SBOM-aware scanner or supply-chain tool.

SBOMs are generated across all ELS for Language Ecosystems languages (Java, JavaScript, Python, PHP, .NET) and published to [TuxCare Nexus](https://nexus.repo.tuxcare.com/). **Access requires TuxCare credentials.**

SBOM repositories are currently published for:

* Java — `els-java-sbom`
* Python — `els-python-sbom`
* JavaScript — `els-js-sbom`

To request credentials, or to check SBOM availability for PHP, .NET, and other ecosystems, contact [sales@tuxcare.com](mailto:sales@tuxcare.com).

## Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX)

TuxCare publishes VEX as CycloneDX VEX documents, distributed alongside each package version and updated with every release. A VEX document tells you which known CVEs actually affect a given artifact version and which don't, so scanner results stay focused on real exposure.

Feeds are published per ecosystem:

* Java - [els_lang_java](https://security.tuxcare.com/vex/cyclonedx/els_lang_java/)
* Python - [els_lang_python](https://security.tuxcare.com/vex/cyclonedx/els_lang_python/) — Python releases iterate as `X.Y.Z.postN+tuxcare` (e.g. `2021.10.8.post2+tuxcare`), not `-tuxcare.N`
* JavaScript - [els_lang_javascript](https://security.tuxcare.com/vex/cyclonedx/els_lang_javascript/)
* PHP - [els_lang_php](https://security.tuxcare.com/vex/cyclonedx/els_lang_php/) — PHP releases iterate as `-pN+tuxcare`, for example `5.2.28-p1+tuxcare`, not `-tuxcare.N`
* .NET - [els_lang_dotnet](https://security.tuxcare.com/vex/cyclonedx/els_lang_dotnet/)

Each entry links one CVE to one artifact version and carries a status:

* **exploitable** — the CVE affects this artifact version and has not yet been patched in this release.
* **resolved** — the CVE has been patched through a TuxCare release.

Each VEX document reports the CVEs that directly affect the artifact. The feed covers every supported base version and every released `-tuxcare.N` iteration, so the entry count reflects these combinations rather than the number of unique CVEs. When checking coverage, filter to the artifact versions you actually use — usually the latest `-tuxcare.N` iteration of your chosen base version. Earlier iterations remain in the feed for historical completeness but aren't relevant once you've adopted a newer release.

## Package Signature Verification (GPG)

Every package TuxCare builds is signed with a detached OpenPGP signature so you can confirm, before installing or updating, that the artifact was produced by TuxCare and has not been altered in transit. The signature is published as a separate `.asc` file in TuxCare Nexus and is created with TuxCare's signing key (SHA-256 detached signature).

A successful verification proves two things about the artifact:

* **Authenticity** — it was signed by TuxCare's private key.
* **Integrity** — its bytes match exactly what was signed; no tampering or corruption occurred.

A failed verification is an **integrity violation**: the artifact must be treated as untrusted and not installed. Do not work around a failed check by re-downloading over an insecure channel or skipping verification — investigate the source instead.

### Where Signatures Are Published

Signature files are published to TuxCare Nexus and require the same credentials as the package repositories. The repository where the `.asc` is published varies by ecosystem: Java publishes it alongside the SBOM, JavaScript uses a dedicated signatures repository, PHP uses the `els_php_raw_custom1` raw repository, and Python publishes it next to each package in the `els_python` package repository. See the per-ecosystem steps under [Verify a Package](#verify-a-package) for the precise repository and path.

### Obtain the TuxCare Public Key

To verify a signature you first need TuxCare's public signing key. Obtain the key from your TuxCare account, or request it from [sales@tuxcare.com](mailto:sales@tuxcare.com) or your TuxCare support contact.

Once you have the key file (for example, `tuxcare-els-public.asc`), import it into your keyring:

```text
gpg --import tuxcare-els-public.asc
```

Confirm it imported by listing the keys in your keyring:

```text
gpg --list-keys
```

:::tip
Import the public key once. It can verify every TuxCare-signed package, so this step is not repeated for each artifact.
:::

### Verify a Package

The verification procedure is the same for every ELS for Language Ecosystems language (Java, JavaScript, Python, PHP, .NET): obtain the exact published artifact, download its detached `.asc` signature from TuxCare Nexus, and run `gpg --verify`. Select your ecosystem below.

:::warning
The signature location and artifact naming vary by ecosystem. The Java, JavaScript, PHP, and Python steps below are confirmed; the .NET steps shown are representative — confirm the exact signatures location and artifact naming for .NET with your TuxCare contact.
:::

<TableTabs label="Choose ecosystem: " :labels="{ DotNET: '.NET' }">

<template #Java>

<ELSSteps>

1. **Obtain the exact published artifact**

   With your TuxCare repository configured (see the [Java libraries](/els-for-libraries/java-libraries/) setup), copy the published `.jar` out of the repository:

   ```text
   mvn dependency:copy \
     -Dartifact=org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:3.12.0-tuxcare.1 \
     -DoutputDirectory=.
   ```

2. **Download the matching signature**

   For Java, the `.asc` is published in the SBOM repository (`els-java-sbom`), keyed by artifact name and version:

   ```text
   curl -u "${USERNAME}:${PASSWORD}" -fsSL \
     https://nexus.repo.tuxcare.com/repository/els-java-sbom/commons-lang3/3.12.0-tuxcare.1/commons-lang3-3.12.0-tuxcare.1.jar.asc \
     -o commons-lang3-3.12.0-tuxcare.1.jar.asc
   ```

3. **Verify the signature against the artifact**

   ```text
   gpg --verify commons-lang3-3.12.0-tuxcare.1.jar.asc commons-lang3-3.12.0-tuxcare.1.jar
   ```

   A `Good signature` line confirms authenticity and integrity. `BAD signature`, or a missing public key, is an integrity violation — stop and re-obtain the package from TuxCare over a trusted channel.

</ELSSteps>

</template>

<template #JavaScript>

<ELSSteps>

1. **Obtain the exact published tarball**

   Verification works on the byte-for-byte artifact that was signed, so download the published `.tgz` rather than repacking it locally. With your TuxCare registry configured (see the [JavaScript libraries](/els-for-libraries/javascript-libraries/) setup), `npm pack` with a version spec downloads the registry tarball as-is:

   ```text
   npm pack @els-js/angular@1.8.3-tuxcare.8
   ```

   This writes `els-js-angular-1.8.3-tuxcare.8.tgz` to the current directory. The filename is normalized by npm, but the contents are identical to the published artifact.

2. **Download the matching signature**

   Fetch the `.asc` file for the same version from the signatures repository, authenticating with the TuxCare registry token you received from [sales@tuxcare.com](mailto:sales@tuxcare.com) (the same token used in your `.npmrc`):

   ```text
   curl -H "Authorization: Basic ${TOKEN}" -fsSL \
     https://nexus.repo.tuxcare.com/repository/els-js-signatures/angular/1.8.3-tuxcare.8/angular-1.8.3-tuxcare.8.tgz.asc \
     -o angular-1.8.3-tuxcare.8.tgz.asc
   ```

3. **Verify the signature against the tarball**

   Pass the signature file first, then the tarball you downloaded:

   ```text
   gpg --verify angular-1.8.3-tuxcare.8.tgz.asc els-js-angular-1.8.3-tuxcare.8.tgz
   ```

   A valid signature produces output similar to:

   ```text
   gpg: Signature made Mon 12 May 2025 10:14:21 UTC
   gpg:                using RSA key <TUXCARE_KEY_ID>
   gpg: Good signature from "TuxCare <...>" [unknown]
   ```

   The `Good signature` line, and a key ID that matches the TuxCare public key you imported, confirm the artifact is authentic and unmodified. The `[unknown]` trust level only reflects that you have not personally signed TuxCare's key in your web of trust; it does not affect the validity of the signature.

</ELSSteps>

</template>

<template #Python>

<ELSSteps>

1. **Obtain the exact published artifact**

   With your TuxCare index configured (see the [Python libraries](/els-for-libraries/python-libraries/) setup), `pip download` fetches the published wheel as-is (the customer index serves wheels):

   ```text
   pip download certifi==2021.10.8.post2+tuxcare --no-deps -d .
   ```

   This writes `certifi-2021.10.8.post2+tuxcare-py2.py3-none-any.whl` to the current directory.

2. **Download the matching signature**

   For Python, the `.asc` is published next to the package in the `els_python` package repository, under `packages/<name>/<version>/`. Authenticate with your TuxCare Nexus credentials:

   ```text
   curl -u "${USERNAME}:${PASSWORD}" -fsSL \
     "https://nexus.repo.tuxcare.com/repository/els_python/packages/certifi/2021.10.8.post2+tuxcare/certifi-2021.10.8.post2+tuxcare-py2.py3-none-any.whl.asc" \
     -o certifi-2021.10.8.post2+tuxcare-py2.py3-none-any.whl.asc
   ```

3. **Verify the signature against the artifact**

   ```text
   gpg --verify certifi-2021.10.8.post2+tuxcare-py2.py3-none-any.whl.asc certifi-2021.10.8.post2+tuxcare-py2.py3-none-any.whl
   ```

   A `Good signature` line confirms authenticity and integrity. `BAD signature`, or a missing public key, is an integrity violation — stop and re-obtain the package from TuxCare over a trusted channel.

</ELSSteps>

</template>

<template #PHP>

<ELSSteps>

1. **Obtain the exact published artifact**

   GPG verifies the byte-for-byte archive that was signed, so use the file exactly as you downloaded it rather than repacking it locally. For PHP, TuxCare publishes the signed archive together with its detached `.asc` signature in the `els_php_raw_custom1` raw repository on TuxCare Nexus, laid out as `<vendor>/<package>/<version>/`.

   Authenticate with the same Nexus credentials you use for the `els_php` Composer repository; any PHP library's setup shows them, for example [PHPMailer](/els-for-libraries/phpmailer/). Then download the archive for the version you use.

   This example uses `symfony/yaml` `v4.4.45-p1+tuxcare`:

   ```text
   curl -u "${USERNAME}:${PASSWORD}" -fsSL \
     https://nexus.repo.tuxcare.com/repository/els_php_raw_custom1/symfony/yaml/v4.4.45-p1+tuxcare/yaml-v4.4.45-p1+tuxcare.zip \
     -o yaml-v4.4.45-p1+tuxcare.zip
   ```

   Check the exact package, version, and path in your TuxCare Nexus account. Signatures are published per artifact, so a package only has an `.asc` if a signed build exists for it.

   Alternatively, verify the copy Composer downloaded during `composer install`, provided it is the same build. Composer stores it under a content-hashed filename such as `<vendor>/<package>/<hash>.zip` in its files cache, so locate it and copy it out under the published name first. The cache location varies by operating system:

   * **Linux**: `~/.composer/cache`, or `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/composer` if set
   * **macOS**: `~/Library/Caches/composer`
   * **Windows**: `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Composer`

   Confirm your exact path with `composer config cache-dir`; the downloaded package archives are stored in its `files/` subdirectory.

2. **Download the matching signature**

   The `.asc` is published next to the archive in the same `els_php_raw_custom1` repository:

   ```text
   curl -u "${USERNAME}:${PASSWORD}" -fsSL \
     https://nexus.repo.tuxcare.com/repository/els_php_raw_custom1/symfony/yaml/v4.4.45-p1+tuxcare/yaml-v4.4.45-p1+tuxcare.zip.asc \
     -o yaml-v4.4.45-p1+tuxcare.zip.asc
   ```

3. **Verify the signature against the artifact**

   ```text
   gpg --verify yaml-v4.4.45-p1+tuxcare.zip.asc yaml-v4.4.45-p1+tuxcare.zip
   ```

   A `Good signature` line confirms authenticity and integrity. `BAD signature`, or a missing public key, is an integrity violation — stop and re-obtain the package from TuxCare over a trusted channel.

</ELSSteps>

</template>

<template #DotNET>

<ELSSteps>

1. **Obtain the exact published artifact**

   With your TuxCare NuGet source configured (see the [.NET libraries](/els-for-libraries/dotnet/) setup), download the published `.nupkg`:

   ```text
   nuget install Newtonsoft.Json -Version 12.0.4-tuxcare.1 -DependencyVersion Ignore -OutputDirectory .
   ```

   The package is written to `./Newtonsoft.Json.12.0.4-tuxcare.1/`; copy the `.nupkg` from there for verification.

2. **Download the matching signature**

   ```text
   curl -u "${USERNAME}:${PASSWORD}" -fsSL \
     https://nexus.repo.tuxcare.com/repository/els-dotnet-signatures/newtonsoft.json/12.0.4-tuxcare.1/newtonsoft.json.12.0.4-tuxcare.1.nupkg.asc \
     -o newtonsoft.json.12.0.4-tuxcare.1.nupkg.asc
   ```

3. **Verify the signature against the artifact**

   ```text
   gpg --verify newtonsoft.json.12.0.4-tuxcare.1.nupkg.asc newtonsoft.json.12.0.4-tuxcare.1.nupkg
   ```

   A `Good signature` line confirms authenticity and integrity. `BAD signature`, or a missing public key, is an integrity violation — stop and re-obtain the package from TuxCare over a trusted channel.

</ELSSteps>

</template>

</TableTabs>

If `gpg` reports `BAD signature`, or cannot find the matching public key, treat the artifact as an integrity violation: stop the installation and re-obtain the package and signature from TuxCare over a trusted channel.

## Integrity Violation Events

An **integrity violation** is any event where an artifact obtained from TuxCare — or the channel it was retrieved over — fails a verification check, indicating the package may not be authentic or may have been altered in transit. The package manager already **blocks** such an operation (the install or update stops), but by default the only trace is the command's exit code and its console output. To align with the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), these events should be treated as security-relevant and retained in a dedicated log so a system administrator can review them regardless of when or how the update was triggered.

### What Counts as an Integrity Violation

The ELS for Language Ecosystems delivery model is a set of per-ecosystem registries hosted on TuxCare Nexus (an npm registry for JavaScript, a PyPI-compatible index for Python, a Maven repository for Java, a Composer repository for PHP, and a NuGet feed for .NET), served exclusively over HTTPS, plus a detached GPG signature published alongside each artifact. Select your ecosystem for the integrity checks — and therefore the violation types — that apply to it:

:::tip
**Metadata signature mismatch** is an OS-package-manager concept (yum/dnf and apt verify a GPG signature over the *repository metadata index* — `repomd.xml`, `InRelease`). The language registries used by ELS for Language Ecosystems — npm, pip, Maven, Composer, and NuGet — do not distribute a separately signed metadata index, so this specific violation type does not map to the setup. The equivalent authenticity and integrity guarantee is provided **per artifact** by the checksum/integrity-hash check and the detached GPG signature listed above.
:::

### Capturing Integrity Violations in a Dedicated Log

Because these checks run inside the package manager (`npm`, `pip`, `mvn`, `composer`, `dotnet`) or `gpg`, their outcome is recorded only in the command's exit code and console output. To retain violations for later review — as CRA expects — run the install or verification inside a wrapper that writes the result to a dedicated log, separate from ordinary build output. Doing this in a CI job or an install/deploy script guarantees the event is captured no matter who triggered the update or whether its output was monitored.

<TableTabs label="Choose ecosystem: " :labels="{ DotNET: '.NET' }">

<template #Java>

`mvn -C` (`--strict-checksums`) makes a checksum mismatch fail the build; TLS to Nexus is always enforced. A failure is written to a dedicated log file and to the system journal. (For Gradle, enable dependency verification and run `./gradlew build` in place of the Maven command.)

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -o pipefail
LOG=/var/log/tuxcare-integrity.log

if mvn -C clean install; then
  logger -t tuxcare-integrity -p authpriv.info "OK: mvn build"

</template>

<template #JavaScript>

`npm ci` enforces the `package-lock.json` integrity hashes (checksum check) and TLS on every download; the on-demand `gpg --verify` adds signature verification. A non-zero exit from either is written to a dedicated log file and to the system journal under a distinct tag.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -o pipefail
LOG=/var/log/tuxcare-integrity.log

run() {
  # $1 = event label, remaining args = the command to check

`--require-hashes` turns on pip's checksum verification against the hashes pinned in `requirements.txt`; TLS to the Nexus index is always enforced. A failure is written to a dedicated log file and to the system journal.

```bash

Composer verifies each downloaded package against the `dist.shasum` in `composer.lock` as a checksum check, and the HTTPS-only `secure-http` setting is enabled by default. A failure is written to a dedicated log file and to the system journal.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -o pipefail
LOG=/var/log/tuxcare-integrity.log

if composer install; then
  logger -t tuxcare-integrity -p authpriv.info "OK: composer install"

  logger -t tuxcare-integrity -p authpriv.err "${msg}"
  exit 1

`dotnet restore --locked-mode` enforces the `packages.lock.json` content hashes (checksum check) and TLS on every download. A failure is written to a dedicated log file and to the system journal.

```bash

set -o pipefail
LOG=/var/log/tuxcare-integrity.log

if dotnet restore --locked-mode; then
  logger -t tuxcare-integrity -p authpriv.info "OK: dotnet restore"

  exit 1

`logger` hands the event to journald/rsyslog under the `tuxcare-integrity` tag. To route these events into their own file, add an rsyslog rule:

```text
# /etc/rsyslog.d/30-tuxcare-integrity.conf
:programname, isequal, "tuxcare-integrity"   /var/log/tuxcare-integrity.log
& stop
```

Reload rsyslog afterwards (`systemctl restart rsyslog`). To review the captured events through journald instead of a file:

```text
journalctl -t tuxcare-integrity
```

:::tip
Forward `/var/log/tuxcare-integrity.log` (or the `tuxcare-integrity` journald tag) to your central log collector or SIEM so integrity violations are alerted on and retained under your standard log-retention policy.
